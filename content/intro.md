My name is John Church. I'm an undergraduate student graduating from Claremont Mckenna College this spring. During my time in college I have studied computer science, philosophy, French, and Arabic. I have been the 
Director of Internal Affairs on the top model UN team on the West Coast, the executive officer for a newspaper, and the principal developer for a real estate fintech startup. In short, I believe that the best education is an interdisciplinary one. I bring a wide variety of experiences and skills to any project that I work on.
