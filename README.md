# Portfolio

Built using Nuxt (VueJS) and TailwindCSS and hosted on Netlify at [jchurch.io](jchurch.io). I designed every component myself save for the form component which is a modified version of the generic form component found on TailwindCSS's website. The form uses Netlify's form tool to send responses to my email.  

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
